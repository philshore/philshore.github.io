      <h2>Hydrodynamic Modelling</h2>

      
            <h3>Engr. Oliver Dan de Luna</h3>
      

        <p><p>Delft3D Flow software was utilized to simulate the tidal behavior of Philippine seas for the country’s assessment of tidal current energy resource. Hydrodynamic modelling of the major regions of Luzon, Palawan and Mindanao seas were conducted and the results were validated against observed data from 45 IHO tidal stations (International Hydrography Organization). The simulation period was 1 year with data recorded every 60 minutes. Input parameters to the model were bathymetry (NAMRIA), sea-bed friction coefficient and the boundary conditions. Tidal harmonic constituents for the boundaries were obtained from a global inverse tidal model (TPXO 7.2). In comparing the model results and data from the tidal stations, the coefficient of determination R2 was used as a measure of goodness-of-fit. With a few exceptions, The R2 were at least 0.85 indicating high agreement between predicted and observed data.</p>

      <h2>Site-Device Matching</h2>

      
            <h3>Engr. Michael Bausas</h3>
      

        <p><p>After potential sites have been identified, performance analysis of various tidal in-stream energy conversion technologies (TISEC) was done.  A working list of 22 TISEC devices was adopted for analysis.  The list was based from a shortlisting made by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in 2014, wherein active TISEC device developers were identified using different criteria – project development; technology classification; evidence of a modelling program; and full-scale.</p>
<p>A comprehensive survey on the technical/operational, as well as economic characteristics of these pre-identified TISEC devices was carried out to develop a TISEC devices database.  The performance analysis of the devices at a given tidal site (based from site resource and suitability analysis) was based on three main factors, namely: annual energy yield, capacity factor and availability factor.  It was originally intended to include the economic characteristics of the devices in the analysis, for the purpose of cost comparison, but was later shelved due to the unavailability of the necessary data.</p>

      <h2>Site-Suitability Analysis</h2>

      
            <h3>Joselito Cruz</h3>
      

        <p><p>In coordination with the Department of Science and Technology, UP College of Geodetic Engineering, the Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry,and  Marine Science Institute, was contracted to develop a tool for local governments that would assist in the developing a renewable tidal current energy integrated resource assessment and spatial planning tool. In particular, the agencies wanted to develop a potential site suitability for some renewable resources. This was accomplished by gathering available data sets and developing geographic information system (GIS) data layers that can be used to determine the suitability of a shoreline for tidal current energy development. Using landscape and seascape areas, and bathymetric data, this GIS modeling effort results in a mapping scheme showing color-coded segments, point-polygon and rasters data for the gathered data came from other local government agencies for renewable resource site suitability assessment.</p>
<p>This also need for implementing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP helps the decision-makers to choose the best solution from several options and selection criteria. It is also used as a decision-making method for broading the applications in operations research and quality engineering. This will model AHP that can generate output that includes measures weights of criteria and selection importance and data consistency.</p>

      <h2>WebGIS Development</h2>

      
            <h3>Engr. Luis Caezar Ian Panganiban,  Engr. Charmyne Mamador</h3>
      

        <p><p>PhilSHORE tool is a web-based GIS (geographic information system) application which allows stakeholders, such as the government, academe and private institutions concerned with ocean renewable energy, to readily assess the potential and suitability of a particular location for ocean energy developments. This service provides data access to different site-suitability layers and device information. Also, it includes a raster calculation function, which can implement a weighted overlay analysis using the different site-suitability factors to create their own energy assessment map. The data available on the map were resource, site suitability and device layers.</p>
<p>The resource layers contains power and velocity which was modelled using Delft3D and regional IHO tide stations. Device performance such as Availability and Capacity Factor and Potential Power, were derived from aforementioned resource layers. PhilSHORE tool was developed using different open-sourced libraries and frameworks like Leaflet JS, D3 JS, GDAL, NumPy, Django and others. Django a python web framework was used as the primary structure for building the application. Geopstial Data Abstraction Library and NumPy were used for manipulating different suitability and device layers. Leaflet JS (<a href="http://leafletjs.com/">http://leafletjs.com/</a>), the primary mapping library used to create the map interface and overlay the different site and device layers. Data Driven Documents JS was used for visualizing site and device data through creating different graphs and charts. The PhilSHORE tool, with its capability to provide initial assessment for determining sites for ocean renewables, is a contribution in the development of Ocean Renewable Energy in the Philippines.</p>
